# Build notes

## 2026-02-14
### ✅ Medication lookup upgrade
- Added curated dataset for GLP-1s, SGLT2s, anticoag, HF, asthma, and ID use cases with dosing, renal, monitoring, and pearls.
- Built an interactive lookup surface with search + tag filters so Derek can jump between classes without leaving the hero page.
- Shortlist panel keeps all visible hits clickable while the main panel exposes the full dosing/monitoring cards.

Next chunk: pipe Brave Search headlines into the hero snapshot + document the API key expectations.
