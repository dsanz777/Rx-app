## 1. Strategic Objectives
1. **Slow progression:** aggressive risk-factor control (BP, A1C, proteinuria) and evidence-based pharmacotherapy.
2. **Dialysis preparedness:** early modality education, vascular access planning, and payer coordination.
3. **Medication stewardship:** reconcile nephrotoxic risks, dose-adjust therapies, optimize anemia/mineral-bone regimens.

## 2. Core Workflows
| Workflow | Trigger | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CKD dashboard sweep | eGFR <45, UACR >30, rapid decline | Analytics + pharmacy |
| Med review cadence | Every visit + within 48h of hospitalization | Pharmacist |
| Dialysis transition huddle | eGFR <20 or RRT within 9 months | Nephrology + care coordination |
| SDOH escalation | Missed labs, transportation barriers | Social work |

## 3. Pharmacy Playbook
- **Layered pharmacotherapy:**
  - ACEi/ARB at maximally tolerated dose for all albuminuric patients.
  - SGLT2 inhibitor if eGFR ≥20; GLP‑1 receptor agonist for metabolic/ASCVD benefit.
  - Finerenone consideration when persistent albuminuria despite ACEi/ARB.
- **Anemia protocols:** Hb <10 → evaluate iron, B12, folate; IV iron first-line if TSAT <30%. ESA initiation per KDIGO.
- **Mineral bone disease:** standardize calcitriol/calcimimetic titration and phosphorus binder algorithm.
- **Drug safety:** global flag for NSAIDs, contrast, metformin hold when eGFR <30 unless supervised.

## 4. Monitoring Matrix
| Metric | Target | Frequency | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BP <130/80 | ≥70% of panel | Every visit/home monitoring | RN/Pharmacy |
| A1C | 6.5–7.5% individualized | Quarterly | PCP/Endocrine |
| UACR reduction | ≥30% from baseline | Semiannual | Pharmacy |
| eGFR slope | <5 mL/min/yr decline | Quarterly review | Nephrology |
| ESA/IV iron documentation | 100% dosing captured | Each infusion | Infusion team |

## 5. Dialysis & Transplant Readiness
1. **Access planning:** referral to vascular surgery when eGFR <25 (fistula first). 
2. **Modality education:** home hemo vs. PD vs. in-center within 6 months of expected RRT.
3. **Transplant fast-track:** HLA typing + psychosocial eval early; maintain vaccination series.
4. **Payer coordination:** confirm MA vs. traditional Medicare billing rules, secondary coverage for supplies.

## 6. Patient-Facing Toolkit
- **“Kidney Protect” cheat sheet:** med list, NSAID avoidance, sick-day rules (hold SGLT2/ACEi if dehydrated).
- **Dietitian script:** sodium <2g/day, protein goals by stage, phosphorus additive education.
- **Transportation + infusion concierge:** dialysis center mapping, rideshare credits, home phlebotomy partners.

## 7. Action Items
1. **Analytics:** deploy CKD trend dashboard + eGFR velocity alerts by Mar 1.
2. **Pharmacy:** standing order set for IV iron + ESA with labs embedded.
3. **Care coordination:** build dialysis/transplant checklist in EHR (goal: pilot by Apr 15).
4. **Quality:** align KPI reporting with CMS Star measures (KED, KED follow-up) and state ESRD metrics.
