# Hospital at Home FAQ

**Status:** Research phase  
**Audience:** Pharmacy + nursing leads evaluating HaH deployment

---

## 1. Program Basics
- **Definition:** Acute-level care delivered at patient residence with daily clinician oversight, remote monitoring, and rapid escalation pathways.
- **Eligibility Snapshot:** Adults with diagnoses such as CHF exacerbation, COPD, CAP, cellulitis, low-risk sepsis. Exclusion criteria include hemodynamic instability, active ICU needs, unsafe home environment.

## 2. Pharmacy Role
- Verify IV-to-PO conversion opportunities before admission.
- Manage on-demand medication kits (antibiotics, anticoag reversal agents, rescue meds).
- Coordinate courier delivery SLAs (<2 hours) for non-kit meds.
- Oversee infusion pump competency for field nurses.

## 3. Tech & Logistics
| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Remote vitals kit | BP, pulse ox, temp, optional weight scale |
| Communication | 24/7 command center, secure chat with field team |
| Transportation | Stat courier + backup rideshare for staff |
| EHR integration | Admission order set, med pass documentation template |

## 4. Daily Workflow (Example)
1. **0700** – Command center huddle, assignment review.
2. **0900** – Nurse visit 1 (assessment, vitals upload, medication admin).
3. **1200** – Virtual physician rounding; pharmacist available for med adjustments.
4. **1600** – Second nurse/wound care visit if ordered.
5. **1900** – Remote monitoring review + escalation if vitals out of range.

## 5. Escalation Ladder
- Green: routine vitals; manage remotely.
- Yellow: mild deviation (e.g., SBP 90–100); immediate virtual review, possible extra visit.
- Red: severe deviation (e.g., SBP <85, SpO₂ <88 on baseline O₂); activate EMS transport to partner hospital.

## 6. Billing & Compliance Nuggets
- CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home waiver in place through at least 2024; verify latest extension.
- Document twice-daily nurse touchpoints + daily physician oversight.
- Maintain chain-of-custody logs for controlled substances delivered to home.

## 7. Open Questions (Research To-Do)
- Finalize list of local partners for portable imaging, phlebotomy, and oxygen delivery.
- Validate malpractice/credentialing requirements for pharmacists conducting home visits.
- Evaluate payer-specific documentation (Humana, BCBS FL) for HaH reimbursement.
