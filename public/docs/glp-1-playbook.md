# GLP-1 Playbook

**Status:** Draft · Needs Derek review  
**Audience:** ACO clinical pharmacists, endocrinology partners, obesity clinics

---

## 1. Patient Selection Snapshot
- Prioritize BMI ≥30 kg/m² or ≥27 with cardiometabolic risk (ASCVD, HTN, dyslipidemia).
- Document A1C trajectory and weight trend over the last 12 months.
- Screen for contraindications: medullary thyroid carcinoma history, MEN2, pancreatitis, severe gastroparesis.
- Capture payer-specific prerequisites (e.g., previous metformin/SGLT2 failure, diet/exercise documentation).

## 2. Baseline Checklist
| Metric | Target / Action |
| --- | --- |
| A1C & fasting glucose | Within last 90 days |
| eGFR, CMP | Within last 6 months; repeat sooner if CKD |
| Weight & waist circumference | Same-day baseline |
| Pregnancy test (if applicable) | Negative test within 7 days |
| Med review | Flag sulfonylureas, insulin doses to down-titrate |

## 3. Titration Guide (Semaglutide/Tirzepatide Focus)
1. **Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy)**
   - 0.25 mg SC weekly ×4 weeks → 0.5 mg ×4 weeks → 1 mg → 1.7 mg → 2 mg (T2D) / 2.4 mg (obesity).
   - Escalate only when GI symptoms minimal for 2 consecutive weeks.
2. **Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound)**
   - 2.5 mg ×4 weeks → 5 mg; increase by 2.5 mg every ≥4 weeks to 10–15 mg.
   - Hold dose if nausea >Grade 2 or weight loss >5 lbs in 2 weeks with dizziness.

## 4. Monitoring & Touchpoints
- **Weeks 0–4:** Weekly texting for GI tolerance, hydration cues, sick-day rules.
- **Week 6:** Virtual check-in; adjust antihyperglycemics/antihypertensives.
- **Week 12:** Clinic or telehealth visit with weight, BP, labs PRN.
- **Quarterly:** A1C (if diabetic), metabolic labs; document percent weight change.

## 5. Prior Authorization Packets
Include:
1. Problem list + ICD-10 codes.
2. Failed therapy grid (drug, start/stop dates, reasons).
3. Lifestyle counseling documentation (RD visits, digital program notes).
4. Risk stratification summary (ASCVD risk, CKD stage, HF status).
5. GLP-1 education handout acknowledgement.

## 6. Risk Mitigation
- Instruct holding dose 7 days pre-op or before prolonged fasting.
- Educate on euglycemic DKA signs when on SGLT2 combos.
- Provide concrete constipation/diarrhea ladders.
- Establish pancreatitis red-flag script (“Call if persistent severe abdominal pain ± vomiting”).

## 7. Outcomes Dashboard (Template)
| Metric | Baseline | 3 mo | 6 mo | 12 mo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weight (lbs) | | | | |
| % Weight change | | | | |
| A1C (%) | | | | |
| Systolic BP | | | | |
| eGFR (mL/min) | | | | |
| PA renewal due | | | | |

## 8. Messaging Snippets
- **Nausea cue:** “Small meals, stop at first sign of fullness, sip 16 oz electrolyte fluid daily.”
- **Plateau coaching:** “Expect weight to slow after 6 months; reinforce resistance training + protein goals.”
- **Surgery hold:** “Skip the dose 1 week before your colonoscopy to avoid anesthesia issues.”
